* Introduction

This is a POC playground for this [[https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/486][PR]] in a bid to understand and hack around with websockets.

*** Setup
First create a virtualenv and activate it

: virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate

Install the deps

: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:

: env FLASK_APP=run.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run

*** Notes

You can use a queue say Redis to read in events(useful for Sheepdog);
this remains explored for now.
